# SBOL Visual Ontology (SBOL-VO)
The SBOL Visual Ontology (SBOL-VO) provides a set of controlled terms to describe visual glyphs for genetic circuit designs.  The terms are organised based on their descriptions in community-edited [Markdown](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SBOL-visual/tree/master/Glyphs) files. Terms are defined for recommended and alternative glyphs in addition to terms to represent generic glyphs. SBOL-VO consists of the following items.

* **A base term**. The base term in the ontology is called "Glyph".
* **Terms for glyphs**. Examples include "AptamerGlyph", "AssemblyScarGlyph" and "AssemblyScarGlyphAlternative".
* **Properties**. SBOL-VO includes object properties such as "hasGlyph" and "isAlternativeOf" to define the relationships between different terms.
* **Annotations**. Terms are annotated using properties such as "defaultGlyph" and "recommended".

## Browse
[Browse the SBOL-VO terms via an HTML page.](https://dissys.github.io/sbol-visual-ontology/sbol-vo.html)

The ontology can also be viewed after downloading and opening in an ontology editor, such as Protege.

## Download
SBOL-VO is available as an RDF file. [Click here](http://dissys.github.io/sbol-visual-ontology/sbol-vo.rdf) to download the ontology. 

## Development
The Python code to generate the ontology is maintained by [Goksel Misirli](mailto:g.misirli@keele.ac.uk) and is available at the [sbol-visual-ontology](https://github.com/dissys/sbol-visual-ontology) GitHub repository.

### Prerequisites
* Make sure you have git and python3 installed. Then install owlready2 and rdflib python libraries. 
```
pip3 install owlready2
pip3 install rdflib
```

* Also make sure you jave Maven and Java installed to update the autogenerated HTML version.

* Download the SBOL-Visual project
```
git clone https://github.com/SynBioDex/SBOL-visual.git
```
 and place it at the same level with the SBOL-Visual-Ontology folder. The parent working folder should look like below:
```
- Parent working folder
  - SBOL-visual
  - sbol-visual-ontology
```

* The edit the python scripts under markdown-to-owl scripts. The main file to execute is Application.py and the changes to the ontology can be done via Ontology.py.

### Updating the HTML documentation
SBOL-VO has an HTML version that is automatically created from the ontology using LODE. 
* Download a forked copy of LODE and run it:
```
git clone https://github.com/dissys/LODE.git
cd LODE
mvn clean jetty:run
```

* Open a web browser and save the output from the following URL as sbol-vo.html, into the sbol-visual-ontology folder, replacing the existing file.
``` 
http://localhost:8080/lode/extract?url=https://dissys.github.io/sbol-visual-ontology/sbol-vo.rdf
```
*  Finally, run the following line to update the autogenerated HTML.
```
cd sbol-vo-update-doc
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="uk.ac.keele.dissys.sbolvo.html.App" 
```

### Submitting changes
Note: Update instructions are adapted from
https://github.com/SynBioDex/SBOL-visual.

Updates should be made in a branch or a separate fork on GitHub. To do this, follow standard git branching or forking procedure.

Here is an example of git commands to achieve this:
```
git clone https://github.com/dissys/sbol-visual-ontology.git
git pull origin master # MAKE SURE NO ONE HAS MADE ANYMORE CHANGES
git checkout -b <newBranch> # CREATE NEW BRANCH
```

 Make your edits and use the following commands to add them to your own GitHub branch.
```
git add <filesYouChanged>
git commit
git push origin <newBranch>
```

#### Synching changes with the SBOL-Visual repository
These changes will then be uploaded to SBOL-visual ontology v2 directory after the changes are reviewed and incorporated. Alternatively, please follow the insructions at https://github.com/SynBioDex/SBOL-visual to incorporate the changes to the https://github.com/SynBioDex/SBOL-visual/tree/master/Ontology/v2 folder directly.
